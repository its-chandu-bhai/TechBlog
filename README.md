<h1> TechBlog Project </h1>
Hi , I'm Chandan Kumar 
This is my first tech blog project which containts some features like as login, logout, post, update profile etc.

This page will have a form where the admin can input their username and password. Upon submission, the credentials will be sent to a servlet for authentication. If authentication is successful, the admin will be redirected to the Admin Dashboard; otherwise, an error message will be displayed. Admin Dashboard (adminDashboard.jsp):

In this project user post his useful thinks to other users. Other users see to their post.

Technologies Used: Servlets: Handle HTTP requests and responses, enabling server-side processing.

JSP (JavaServer Pages): Generates dynamic web pages to interact with users.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Facilitates interaction with the MySQL database.

JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library): Provides tags to simplify the presentation of data in JSP pages.

MySQL: A relational database management system used to store application data.

I have successfully completed the TechBlog Project  (Part of devops) under guidance of Durgesh Sir.
